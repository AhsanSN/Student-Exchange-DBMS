# Student-Exchange-DBMS
For our project, we will be building a system for a global student exchange program, such as AISEC. Our system will include an initial ER Diagram, which will be followed by a complete Database, which we will then manipulate using a front-end interface, a website. This website will mainly be for administrative use, but a portion of the website will be available to the general public to view programs and apply for them.
The Global Student Exchange Program has branches worldwide. These branches in different countries, are in different cities from where students are selected for the exchange program. Students before they get selected apply for exchange programs, apply for a program in their particular city chapter. Some students are selected by that city chapter and sent to other country to a city to work with the organization whose program it is. Students pay some fixed portion of the fee. These programs are funded by sponsors. The programs are created by worldwide NGOâ€™s, startups, and companies. Students after returning from a program give their statements that are recorded.

### Potential Transactions

1. Adding payment from a paid program to a student's total earning.

2. Ending the program and entering the final report
